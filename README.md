# Github OAuth App

## Purpose

This project was made to illustrate the skills I've learnt in authentification and authorization. This project uses Expressjs with the passport module to authorize a user to access their account using Github as the authentification method. In this project I specifically worked on the app.js file to get this project to work. The remaining code was supplied by [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) as part of their full-stack engineering career path.
